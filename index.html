		<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p>Since I was little I was always with legos and I want to step it up a notch. So what interests me the most is rockets and vehicles. Egineering is my top choice right now. Im doing my best to go to McBride high school and their great Egineering program where they make cars and boats and other cool things.</p>

		<h2>Family</h2>
			<p>My parents are both from Mexico and moved to the United States to start a family. They bought a apartment and had my sister Miriam on December 30 2000. Then 3 years later my parents had me Antonio on September 14 2003. My parents raised us Catholic and I attend youth groups and mass on sundays. My sister and I do get along but it get of hand. I grew up like every other kid we moved to a house I attended Cleveland Elemetry and had friends. Still most of my friends are still friends. </p>
